## Digital Puppets and Embodied Agents

See https://github.com/orbitalfoundation/orbital-puppet

Embodied interfaces may be satisfying to people who are not adapted to 2d interfaces or who were not part of the first wave of technology adoption. For example less than 20% of people can touch type fluently, and there are still billions of people who have never used a computer.

As humans we have wetware that processes human faces and gestures. It can be a more powerful learning mechanism or communication mechanism even for people who are used to 2d interfaces.

The technical challenge is interesting by itself. Syncing mouth movement provides a sense of presence and aliveness is tricky. Presence as a whole can be conveyed by accurate emotions, breath pauses and breathing, body guestures matching conversation, body language in general, blinking, facial ticks, and gaze as well. However at the same time avoiding an uncanny valley effect is a balancing act.
